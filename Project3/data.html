          There are many misconceptions about the personality and temperament of "bully breeds", especially pit bull mixes. They are often perceived as violent, unfriendly, and dangerous to other dogs. In reality, pit bull mixes are typically great dogs around children, are very friendly with other dogs, and have a lot of energy to play. Back in the 1980's, pit bull mixes were the dog of choice for dog fights, despite the fights being illegal. This led to unnecessary bans on pit bull breeds, even though their poor behavior can be attributed to poor training by owners and backyard breeders incorrectly breeding the dog. According to the American Temperament Test Society (ATTS), the American Pit Bull Terrier was rated at an 87.7% success rate when tested in various stressful situations. In fact, all of the breeds categorized as "bully breeds" scored an 80% or higher (with the exception of one) on this test. It is statistics like these that will help educate everyone on common misunderstandings about pit bull mixes, as well as other bully breeds.

         The stigma against pit bull mixes is slowly being broken with organizations like the Austin Animal Center. After visiting their facility many times because I just love dogs that much, I realized that the majority of their dogs were pit bull mixes. This broke my heart entirely, because of how misunderstood the dogs are. When I was going through the process of adopting my pit mix, I found out that they have behavioral specialists who work on site to train new dogs how to behave. I believe that this is one of the ways animal shelters can make the adoption of pit bull mixes more attractive. When I first adopted my pit mix and met with the behavioral specialists, I immediately noticed how she greeted me, how she responded to the trainers, and the commands that she already knew. I was highly impressed with how much she learned while in the shelter, and I think it's situations like these that are so vital to breaking the stigma that pit bull mixes are violent or threatening. There seems to be a heavier concentration of pit mix adoptions in 2017 and 2018 which means the shelter is on its way to ideally breaking stereotypes against the breed.

        Most of the dogs found are within the bounds of Interstate 35 and Mopac 1, which would classify them as dogs found within city limits. There seems to be a higher concentration of pit bull mixes found in North Austin. Many suburbs are in this area, and a couple of patches of older neighborhoods. While some of these addresses are listed as intersections, it can be inferred that some of these areas are more common places for pit bull mixes to be found. It can be inferred that these dogs belong to families but can easily get out of their yards.
